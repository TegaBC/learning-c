# Dice Roll Simulator

Simulates rolling a dice...

## What it taught me?
- Surprisingly i've never used the modulus operator in other languages since im bad at maths,
but now I understand how it worked in the use case of getting a random number between certain bounds.

- Learnt that in C i can set a variable in a condition whilst evaluating that condition, can make certain lines of code very small.
- Learnt about the input buffer and stdin a bit better, makes a bit more sense now to why my code was looping and breaking a lot.
- Now understood that \n was taking up my string making me have to clear the input buffer when i could have just made it bigger

- Learnt about colours and how #define works with string literals and the difference between them and variables
